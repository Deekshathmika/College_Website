     <h2 class="text-primary">MIST HOSTEL</h2>
     A hostel is a place where students can get food and lodging.Life in a hostel is not the same as life at home.When a student's home is too faraway from his/her educational institution,he/her will usually stay in a hostel.A hostel makes the student self-dependent.The hostel is maintained by or is under the direct control and management and admits only students from the collage.
     In june 2019,Mahaveer Educationa Society(MES) opened its hostel in the collage campus,with seperate hostels for boys and girls,modern amenities,and an attached mess.Fresh and hygienic food is served in the hostel mess.
     Our college hostel is fully furnished with separate rooms for boys and girls. The hostels are purpose-built with two primary goals: safety and comfort. It is secured 24 hours a day and adheres to stringent security procedures, and is comfortable for our students to live in. The hostels are equipped with state-of-the-art restrooms (toilet and bathing cells). The staff on duty ensures that the area is kept clean. Each hostel room provides an inviting atmosphere and a pollution-free environment.
