</P>
    <li>IT</li>
<p>
    The department of IT was established in the year 2005 and quenches the thirst of knowledge of students effectively which meets the highest level of competency required by the industry. With its experienced faculty members having excellent academic backgrounds, it trains students supplementing classroom lectures with computer aided demonstrations making their learning a rich and rewarding experience.
</p>
    <li>ECE</li>
<p>
    Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering was established in 2001 with an intake of 60 B.Tech students, subsequently got increase in intake to 120 students in the year 2004 and 180 students in the year 2012.Also got the approval for M.Tech in DE&CS, VLSI with intake of 18 students in each course in year 2007 & 2009 respectively. Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is one of the largest and fastest-growing field of Engineering. 
</p>
    <li>EEE</li>
<p>
    The EEE Department at MIST operates with one eye on excellence and the other one on the future. This is because we know how fast the world is changing. Hence, our students are armed with not just the traditional knowledge and wisdom in the field of electrical engineering, but also with an interdisciplinary perspective that helps them to work in tandem with other specializations in the world of technology and science.
</p>
    <li>AERO</li>
<p>
    The Aeronautical Engineering Department came into existence at this Institute during the year 2011.Presently,the Institute offers only the undergraduate programme i.e. B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering . Aeronautical Engg is an advanced, multidisciplinary branch of engineering that encompasses technologies from mechanical engg,civil engg, metallurgical engg ,electrical engg,electronics and telecommunications engg ,computer science and engg, material science ,pure sciences etc.
